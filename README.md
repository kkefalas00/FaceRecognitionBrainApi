# The faceRecognition Api is the first web App which I created after the completion of the Udemy course - Complete Web Developer by Andrei Neagoie. 
# In order to complete this app I used React, Node.js and PostgreSQL.
# The app uses an api from the clarifai which detects a face from an image.
# The user can sign in, register , see his profile and also can put an image url.
# The app finally can detect through the connection to the clarifai api the image and construct a box to the face of the image.
